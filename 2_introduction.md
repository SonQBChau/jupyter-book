# 2. Introduction

APIs have been present for decades and are set to grow exponentially, in part due to regulations (in public health or finance) or by industry interoperability (in telecommunications) or disruption (in media or retail) {cite}`wang_mclarty_2021`. As a cybersecurity company focused on API management at a global scale, TeejLab aims to tackle this key industry challenge of **quantifying business risk at the API level**. A manual inspection or a rules-based approach is insufficient to accurately capture various aspects of risk, such as security, legal, similarity, and data sovereignty. In addition to those listed previously, the legal aspect is related to the level of protection for users for data use and distribution. Finally, similarity refers to how much user data APIs in the same category are requesting, where one that is requesting for too much data is deemed as less secure.

Based on the dataset provided and time limitations, our team has narrowed the scope to focus on creating a machine learning pipeline to **quantify the risk of the endpoints of each API based on security and data sovereignty markers**. Our final data product will be a well-annotated python script for each stage - (1) data pre-processing and feature engineering, and (2) machine learning. As this is an unchartered field of research, our team also aims to create a framework for API risk assessment.
